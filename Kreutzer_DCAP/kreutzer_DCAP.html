Endurance athletes frequently employ nutritional strategies to enhance
performance. While professional organizations recommend high
carbohydrate diets to maximize performance, many athletes, and
researchers have recently shown renewed interest in the ketogenic diet
in hopes to promote “fat adaptation”, which would allow athletes to make
use of the essentially unlimited energy resources from stored body fat.
This would circumvent one fatigue mechanism, the depletion of muscle
glycogen stores, that has been considered central to performance
outcomes in endurance events. The present study investigated the effects
of participants’ habitual diet, high carbohydrate diet, and ketogenic
diet on endurance performance in a 30-km simulated cycling time trial,
physiological responses during the time trial, and muscle session fuel
percentile before and after the time trial using ultrasonic imaging. Due
to the COVID-19 pandemic, data collection ceased after only six
recreational cyclists and triathletes (f = 4, m = 2; age: 37.2 ± 12.2;
VO2max: 46.8 ± 6.8 ml/kg/min; weekly cycling distance: 225.3 ± 64.2 km).
Due to the small sample size, we do not report inferential statistics
for our primary outcome measure, cycling performance. Participants
produced the lowest mean power output during the time trial following
the ketogenic diet (172 ± 93 W) and the highest mean power output
following the high carbohydrate diet (200 ± 92 W). Oxygen consumption,
heart rate, and perceived exertion during the time trial were similar in
all conditions. Fat oxidation rates were highest in the ketogenic diet
condition (0.62 ± 0.11 g/min) and lowest in the high carbohydrate
condition (0.14 ± 0.11 g/min). Session fuel percentile was lower
following the ketogenic diet compared with the habitual diet (Mean
Difference = -10.0 ± 12.7 %) and lower following the time trial compared
with fasted resting values across all conditions. We discuss
methodological considerations into the use of exercise equipment,
nutritional interventions, and statistical analysis strategies for study
designs like the present. Further research is needed to assess the
impact of high carbohydrate and ketogenic diets on time trial
performance in this population. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Nutritional interventions remain at the forefront of strategies
employed by athletes to enhance their performance <span
class="citation">(<a href="#ref-1" role="doc-biblioref">Thomas et al.,
2016</a>)</span>. Commonly employed approaches among endurance athletes
include a high daily intake of dietary carbohydrate (6-10 g/kg/day) and
carbohydrate loading (10-12 g/kg/day) before an event, since low muscle
glycogen is a well-established cause of fatigue <span
class="citation">(<a href="#ref-2" role="doc-biblioref">Jeukendrup,
2004</a>, <a href="#ref-3" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>.
Contrary to this traditionally favored strategy, endurance athletes and
researchers have recently began expressing increased interest in a low
carbohydrate, high fat ketogenic diet again <span class="citation">(<a
href="#ref-4" role="doc-biblioref">Burke, 2017</a>)</span>. When
following a ketogenic diet, athletes typically limit their carbohydrate
intake to &lt;50 g or 5-10% of their total daily energy intake <span
class="citation">(<a href="#ref-5" role="doc-biblioref">Feinman et al.,
2015</a>)</span>. The proposed benefit of this diet approach is “fat
adaptation”, enabling the oxidation of fat as the main energy substrate
at exercise intensities (e.g. &gt;70% of maximal oxygen consumption
VO<sub>2</sub>max) where the oxidation of carbohydrate would typically
predominate <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-6"
role="doc-biblioref">Carey et al., 1985</a>; <a href="#ref-7"
role="doc-biblioref">Lambert et al., 1994</a>, <a href="#ref-8"
role="doc-biblioref">1997</a>)</span>. This would essentially create
unlimited energy resources, as the body can store more than 74,000 kcal
in subcutaneous, visceral, and intramuscular fat <span
class="citation">(<a href="#ref-9" role="doc-biblioref">Kenney et al.,
2020</a>)</span>. Despite its recent resurgence in popularity, the
ketogenic diet’s restrictive nature counters the current dietary
recommendations of several professional organizations, which state that
low carbohydrate availability before exercise is a significant component
of diminished exercise capacity and performance <span
class="citation">(<a href="#ref-10" role="doc-biblioref">Burke et al.,
2019</a>; <a href="#ref-11" role="doc-biblioref">Kerksick et al.,
2017</a>; <a href="#ref-1" role="doc-biblioref">Thomas et al.,
2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Two factors influencing the effect of low carbohydrate diets on
endurance performance appear to be the length of adaptation and the
duration and intensity of the event. Short-term low carbohydrate diets
of one to four days lead to impaired glycogen storage <span
class="citation">(<a href="#ref-12" role="doc-biblioref">Galbo et al.,
1979</a>)</span>, which can cause substantial decreases in exercise
performance <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-12"
role="doc-biblioref">Galbo et al., 1979</a>; <a href="#ref-13"
role="doc-biblioref">Pitsiladis &amp; Maughan, 1999</a>)</span>.
However, even with as little as five days of implementing low
carbohydrate diets, increased fat oxidation rates have been reported
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-16" role="doc-biblioref">Burke et
al., 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-15" role="doc-biblioref">Burke &amp;
Hawley, 2002</a>; <a href="#ref-14" role="doc-biblioref">Goedecke et
al., 1999</a>)</span>. While this increase in fat oxidation is a
consistent finding among most studies investigating the effect of low
carbohydrate diets in endurance athletes <span class="citation">(<a
href="#ref-18" role="doc-biblioref">Burke et al., 1985</a>, <a

href="#ref-25" role="doc-biblioref">Zinn et al., 2017</a>)</span>, the
results regarding exercise performance are less clear.</p>
<p>Recent studies comparing ketogenic to habitual or mixed control diets
have shown decreases <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-25"
role="doc-biblioref">Zinn et al., 2017</a>)</span> or no differences
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-26" role="doc-biblioref">Shaw et
al., 2019</a>)</span> in time to exhaustion following prolonged diet
adherence. However, early studies employing a direct comparison of
ketogenic and high carbohydrate diets and their effects on prolonged
endurance exercise performance have produced ambiguous results <span
class="citation">(<a href="#ref-27" role="doc-biblioref">Bergström &amp;
Hultman, 1967</a>; <a href="#ref-12" role="doc-biblioref">Galbo et al.,

1994</a>; <a href="#ref-28" role="doc-biblioref">Phinney et al.,
1983</a>)</span>. <span class="citation">Lambert et al. (<a
href="#ref-7" role="doc-biblioref">1994</a>)</span> reported improved
time to exhaustion at moderate cycling intensity (50% of peak power
output) following two weeks of a ketogenic compared with a high
carbohydrate diet, but not at high intensity (85 % of peak power
output). Similarly, <span class="citation">Burke et al. (<a
href="#ref-18" role="doc-biblioref">1985</a>)</span> reported no
difference in 7 kJ/kg time trial performance immediately following 120
min of steady state cycling at 70% of VO<sub>2</sub>max after a five-day
low carbohydrate diet (2.4 g/kg/day carbohydrate; 4 g/kg/day fat) with
one-day carbohydrate restoration compared with an isoenergetic high
carbohydrate diet (9.6 g/kg/day carbohydrate; 0.7 g/kg/day fat). <span
class="citation">Prins et al. (<a href="#ref-23"
role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> compared the effects of 42-day
ketogenic and high-carbohydrate diets on 5 km running performance at
four separate points of each diet. They reported that running time was
significantly faster during high carbohydrate (60–65% carbohydrate; 20%
fat) when compared with the ketogenic diet (&lt; 50 g/day carbohydrate;
75-80% fat) on day four of each diet, but not at any other point during
the diets. This again indicates that exercise performance might be
maintained at higher intensities. However, in a more recent study, <span
class="citation">Burke et al. (<a href="#ref-19"
role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> compared the effect of a 3-week
high carbohydrate diet (8.6 g/kg/day carbohydrate; 1.2 g/kg/day fat), a
carbohydrate diet (8.3 g/kg/day carbohydrate; 1.2 g/kg/day fat), and a
ketogenic diet (&lt; 50 g/day carbohydrate; 4.7 g/kg/day fat) on 10 km
race-walking performance; they found that race time improved
significantly in the high carbohydrate and periodized carbohydrate
groups, but remained unchanged in the ketogenic diet group. A recent
replication study <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-20"
role="doc-biblioref">Burke et al., 2020</a>)</span> produced similar
results. Additionally, Burke et al. <span class="citation">(<a
href="#ref-19" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>, <a href="#ref-20"
role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>, <a href="#ref-16"
role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> have elucidated a potential
mechanism for performance impairment following a ketogenic diet at
higher intensities; specifically, they showed that exercise economy is
reduced following a ketogenic compared to high carbohydrate and
periodized carbohydrate diets.</p>
<p>While a number of studies have investigated the effect of ketogenic
and high carbohydrate diets on exercise performance, results remain
conflicting <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-18"
role="doc-biblioref">Burke et al., 1985</a>, <a href="#ref-19"
role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>, <a href="#ref-20"
role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>, <a href="#ref-16"
role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>; <a href="#ref-7"
role="doc-biblioref">Lambert et al., 1994</a>; <a href="#ref-22"
role="doc-biblioref">McSwiney et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-23"
role="doc-biblioref">Prins et al., 2019</a>)</span>, in part due to
small sample sizes, limited participation of female athletes across a
wide age range, heterogenous interventions, and testing protocols. Our
current study employed a performance assessment (time trial) that was
representative of the type of races in which our population competes.
This approach maximized the external validity of our study while still
allowing measurements in a controlled laboratory setting. While previous
studies have evaluated performance under ecological conditions, such as
during officially sanctioned races <span class="citation">(<a
href="#ref-19" role="doc-biblioref">Burke et al., 2017</a>, <a
href="#ref-20" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>, we believe our
approach is unique in allowing participants to use their own equipment
while completing a representative performance assessment that maximized
control of the measurements. Finally, to our knowledge, no studies have
used a randomized crossover design that directly compares the effects of
habitual, ketogenic, and high carbohydrate diets on prolonged endurance
performance.</p>
<p>We intended to address the gaps in the literature with the present
study and aimed to collect data from 30 male and female cyclists across
a wide age range (18-70 years old). We hypothesized that the high
carbohydrate diet would lead to improved performance (faster time trial
completion) compared with the ketogenic and habitual diets. However, due
to restrictions on data collection caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the
results presented in the present manuscript should be considered as
insights from a pilot study only, i.e., we were unable to address the
issues of small sample sizes in this area of research. Since the
originally estimated sample size to detect a meaningful difference in
performance (see <a href="#power-analysis">Power Analysis</a> section)
was not achieved, primary outcomes are presented as means and standard
deviations only; reflections on potential inferential statistical
analysis techniques and other methodological considerations regarding
performance measurement, muscle glycogen estimation in response to the
diets using high-frequency ultrasound <span class="citation">(<a
href="#ref-29" role="doc-biblioref">Hill &amp; San Millán,
2014</a>)</span>, and participant adherence to the interventions are

<h2>Study Preregistration</h2>
<p>This study was preregistered at Open Science Framework (<a

at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04097171).</p>
</div>
<div id="experimental-design" class="section level2">
<h2>Experimental Design</h2>
<p>The study employed crossover design, where each participant served as
their own control. Participants adhered to 14 days each of a ketogenic
and a high carbohydrate diet in a counter-balanced randomized order.
Diet order was randomized employing block randomization in the blockrand
package <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-30"
role="doc-biblioref">Snow, n.d.</a>)</span> in R <span
class="citation">(<a href="#ref-31" role="doc-biblioref"><em>R: A
Language and Environment for Statistical Computing</em>,
n.d.</a>)</span>. The syntax for the block randomization can be found at
<a href="https://osf.io/ujx6e/" class="uri">https://osf.io/ujx6e/</a>.
Participant eligibility, anthropometric measurements, and
VO<sub>2</sub>max were determined during two screening visits. During
the third visit, all participants completed the experimental procedures
following their habitual diet and ingesting a test meal with
macronutrient contents similar to a typical American diet <span
class="citation">(<a href="#ref-32" role="doc-biblioref">Shan et al.,
2019</a>)</span>. During the ketogenic and high carbohydrate trials,
participants underwent the same procedures, but consumed a test meal
corresponding to their diet condition. A diagram showing the
experimental design is presented in Figure 1. The study was approved by
the TCU Institutional Review Board (IRB). All procedures were performed
according to the Declaration of Helsinki principles for research
involving human participants.</p>

<h2>Participants</h2>
<p>Endurance-trained recreational cyclists and triathletes were
recruited from the local cycling and triathlon community using flyers,
social media, and word of mouth. A total of 46 individuals were assessed
for eligibility, 19 of which were unable to begin the study due to
COVID-19 restrictions on in-person research. A further six participants
started the study, but were unable to finish the entire protocol due to
these restrictions. Thus, six participants (m = 2, f = 4) completed the
study. The study was unable to achieve the originally estimated sample
size of 30 participants due to data collection restrictions caused by
the COVID-19 pandemic. Figure 2 presents a CONSORT diagram for the
present study</p>

their sex and age group according to guidelines put forth by the

included one male in Performance Level 2 and one male in Performance
Level 1 as described by <span class="citation">Pauw K et al. (<a
href="#ref-35" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>. Further, our study
included three female participants in Performance Level 3 and one in
Performance Level 1 according to criteria established by <span

important to note that all participants achieved at least Performance
Level 3 based on weekly mileage and cycling experience. Further, the
male participant classified as Performance Level 2 would have achieved
Performance Level 4 or Performance Level 5 based on absolute or relative
peak power output respectively. Participant characteristics are shown in

<p>Exclusion criteria included the self-reported use of medications or
supplements to lose weight, following a ketogenic (&lt;10% or less of
total energy intake from carbohydrates), a high carbohydrate diet
(&gt;65% of total energy intake from carbohydrate), or weight loss diet.
Further, nicotine use or heavy alcohol consumption (&gt;14 units of
alcohol/week for males; &gt;7 units of alcohol/week for females) were
considered reasons for exclusion. Potential participants were also
excluded if they self-reported any food allergies to ingredients used in
our test meals. Known cardiovascular disease was cause for exclusion
unless participation was approved by the participant’s cardiologist.
Self-reported presence of diabetes, stroke, anemia, eating disorders,
uncontrolled hypertension, or pulmonary, liver, kidney, and untreated
thyroid disease, or orthopedic, arthritis, or musculoskeletal problems
that would have prevented exercise excluded prospective participants
from enrolling in the study. Potential participants were also excluded

<div id="power-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Power Analysis</h2>
<p>We performed a simulation-based power analysis using the Superpower
package <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-38"
role="doc-biblioref">Lakens &amp; Caldwell, 2021</a>)</span> in R <span
class="citation">(<a href="#ref-31" role="doc-biblioref"><em>R: A
Language and Environment for Statistical Computing</em>,
n.d.</a>)</span>. Based on unpublished data collected in our lab in a
representative sample, we expected the time trial to take approximately
60 ± 6 min. The within-subjects correlation between repeated time trials
in our pilot work was 0.98; high within-subjects correlations (r = 0.89)
have been shown in the existing literature <span class="citation">(<a
href="#ref-18" role="doc-biblioref">Burke et al., 1985</a>)</span>. To
employ a conservative approach, we elected to use the average of the
within-subjects correlation in our pilot work and in <span
class="citation">Burke et al. (<a href="#ref-18"
role="doc-biblioref">1985</a>)</span>, resulting in r = 0.93 for our
power analysis. We analyzed finishing times from the past four years
(2015-2018) of the Texas State Time Trial Championships to establish a
practically meaningful effect size. In male and female athletes of age
groups up to 55+ years old, the average finishing time of the top 10
riders was 61 ± 6 min. On average, an improvement of 1.5 min would have
resulted in a rider moving up by one place in the final standings.
Therefore, we decided on a meaningful difference of 90 seconds for our
power analysis. All finishing times used in our analysis can be found at
<a href="https://osf.io/ujx6e/" class="uri">https://osf.io/ujx6e/</a>.
At an alpha level of 0.05, our power analysis revealed that 30
participants would have yielded 90% power for the omnibus linear model
for time to completion of the 30-km time trial. The syntax for the power
analysis can be found at <a href="https://osf.io/ujx6e/"
class="uri">https://osf.io/ujx6e/</a>. As discussed, we were unable to
reach our desired sample size due to COVID-19 restrictions on in-person
research. Therefore, we do not present any inferential statistics for
our primary outcome measure.</p>

<div id="visit-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Visit 1</h3>
<p>Following a 12-hour overnight fast, participants reported the
laboratory for Visit 1, which included completing informed consent and
demographic, behavioral, and health questionnaires. Additionally,
participants underwent anthropometric measurements (height, body mass,
waist, and hip circumference). Further, we assessed participants’ body
composition using air displacement plethysmography with measured
thoracic lung volume (BOD POD, COSMED USA Inc., Concord, CA). Following
body composition and anthropometric measurements, we assessed
participants’ resting metabolic rate via indirect calorimetry using the
ParvoMedics TrueOne® 2400 metabolic cart (ParvoMedics, Sandy, UT, USA)
with a ventilated hood system.</p>
</div>
<div id="visit-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Visit 2</h3>
<p>At Visit 2, participants performed an incremental exercise test to
task failure to determine VO<sub>2</sub>max using a CompuTrainer®
ergometer (RacerMate Inc., Seattle, WA). Participants were instructed to
refrain from any exercise in the 24 hours leading up to

<h2>Experimental Trials</h2>
<p>Participants reported to the laboratory following a 12-hour overnight
fast. Additionally, they performed only light to moderate exercise 24-48
hours prior to testing and refrained from all exercise in the 24 hours
leading up to the experimental trials. Upon arrival, participants
underwent measurements of body mass, capillary beta-hydroxybutyrate
concentration, and an ultrasonic assessment of the right and left rectus
femoris. Following resting measures, participants consumed a liquid test
meal approximately 180 min prior to the start of the time trial. They
were allowed ten minutes to consume the test meal in its entirety; time
to consume the meal was standardized between trials based on the time
taken for consumption of the meal during the initial trial. Following
180 minutes of supine rest and postprandial measures described elsewhere
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-37" role="doc-biblioref">Graybeal
et al., 2021</a>)</span>, participants underwent rectus femoris
ultrasound assessment and provided capillary samples for

<h2>Dietary Interventions, Compliance, and Training</h2>
<p>Dietary interventions, compliance measures, and experimental controls
regarding physical activity are described in detail elsewhere <span
class="citation">(<a href="#ref-37" role="doc-biblioref">Graybeal et
al., 2021</a>)</span>. We did not prescribe energy and nutrient intake
during the habitual diet; rather, participants completed 3-day dietary
records to quantify their habitual intake before Experimental Trial 1.
The average energy and macronutrient content of the habitual diet is
shown in Table 2. Thereafter, they followed a ketogenic (&lt;10%
carbohydrate, 75-85% fat, 15% protein) and high carbohydrate diet
(&gt;65% carbohydrate, &lt;20% fat, 15% protein) in randomized order.
Similar to previous studies, we did not include a washout period between
diets to maximize participant retention <span class="citation">(<a
href="#ref-39" role="doc-biblioref">Hall et al., 2021</a>)</span>.
Considering that adaptations to the ketogenic diet can be rapid and
quickly reversed by reintroducing carbohydrate, we believe that the lack
of a washout period did not have undue influence on our results <span
class="citation">(<a href="#ref-40" role="doc-biblioref">Shilpa &amp;
Mohan, 2018</a>)</span>. We considered participants to be compliant with
the diet if they met carbohydrate macronutrient percentages on at least
80% of days. Compliance with the diets was assessed by a registered
dietitian via daily diet logging and daily check-ins using mobile
applications (WhatsApp, WhatsApp Inc., Mountain View, CA; NutritIO,
Bucharest, Romania). Further, participants provided capillary
beta-hydroxybutyrate samples at each experimental trial and seven days
into each diet, as well as daily images of urinary ketone body test
strips (VALI, CA) to test for ketosis, i.e., urinary
beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration ≥ 0.5 mmol/L <span
class="citation">(<a href="#ref-41" role="doc-biblioref">Misra &amp;
Oliver, 2015</a>)</span>. We instructed participants to attempt to
maintain body mass throughout the study and considered weight
maintenance as a body mass loss or gain of no more than 5%.</p>
<p>During experimental trials, participants consumed liquid test meals
containing 60% of the participants’ measured Resting Metabolic Rate
(kcals/day). All meals were dairy-based shakes, which have been
described in detail elsewhere <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-37"
role="doc-biblioref">Graybeal et al., 2021</a>)</span>. Test meal
compositions corresponded to a typical American Diet, as outlined by
<span class="citation">Shan et al. (<a href="#ref-32"
role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>, for the habitual diet (31.4% fat,
53.4% carbohydrate, 15.2% protein) and to the respective dietary
interventions following the high carbohydrate diet (15.7% fat, 69.1%
carbohydrate, 15.2% protein) and the ketogenic diet (75.1% fat, 9.5%
carbohydrate, 15.4% protein); test meal volumes and caloric content were
the same across conditions. Test meals were consumed in the same amount
of time in each condition. Participants consumed standardized amounts of
water during the postprandial period and were provided with and
instructed to ingest the same volume of water during each time trial. We
instructed participants to keep their training levels stable throughout
the study. We monitored training using self-reported written training
logs including distance covered, time spent, and rating of perceived
exertion for the session (RPE; 1-10). We calculated session RPE by
multiplying the indicated RPE by the time elapsed during the
session.</p>

<h2>Measures</h2>
<div id="exercise-equipment" class="section level3">
<h3>Exercise Equipment</h3>
<p>To ensure familiarity with the exercise equipment and to avoid
learning effects across trials, participants completed all testing on
their personal bicycles mounted to a CompuTrainer® cycling ergometer
(RacerMate Inc., Seattle, WA), which has previously been shown to be
reliable in time trial tasks similar to the present study <span
class="citation">(<a href="#ref-42" role="doc-biblioref">Sparks et al.,
2016</a>)</span>. The CompuTrainer® was calibrated according to
manufacturer’s recommendations, and tire pressure was standardized for
each trial at 100 psi or the maximal tire pressure recommended by the
manufacturer. Participants were asked to remove devices from their
bicycles or deactivate any devices that could give them feedback on
their exercise performance, such as power meters and cycle computers.
The only data displayed to participants during the time trial were
distance and gradient of the road.</p>
</div>
<div id="vo2max-testing" class="section level3">
<h3>VO<sub>2</sub>max Testing</h3>
<p>For the 24 hours leading up to testing, participants were asked to
refrain from all exercise. For the initial incremental maximal exercise
test, participants warmed up for 5 min at a self-selected intensity.
Thereafter, participants began the incremental test at a load of 50-100
watts (W). Exercise intensity was increased by 25 W per minute until
task failure. Oxygen uptake (V̇O2) was continuously monitored using a
TrueOne 2400 metabolic cart (Parvo Medics, Sandy, UT, USA) and heart
rate was collected throughout the test using a Polar H7 HR monitor
(Polar Inc., Lake Success, NY). VO<sub>2</sub>max was defined as the
highest 30-second V̇O2 value obtained during the test. To ensure validity
of the VO<sub>2</sub>max measurement, participants performed a
validation bout at 110% of their peak power output achieved in the
initial test following at least 15 min rest as described by <span
class="citation">Poole &amp; Jones (<a href="#ref-poole2017measurement"
role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>. Peak power output was calculated
as described by <span class="citation">Hawley &amp; Noakes (<a
href="#ref-hawley1992" role="doc-biblioref">1992</a>)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
PPO=P_{final}+\frac{t}{60} \cdot 25
\]</span></p>
<p>where Pfinal is the highest work rate achieved and t is the time
completed in the final stage. Following a two-minute warmup at 100 W,
participants performed a steady work rate test that achieved exhaustion
within three to six min. If the greatest V̇O2 measured during this
validation test did not exceed the VO<sub>2</sub>max measured during the
incremental test, considering a possible ~3% measurement error based on
the equipment used, the achievement of a V̇O2 plateau was accepted. When
the V̇O2 achieved during validation exceeded that measured during the
incremental test, a new incremental test was performed on a separate
day.</p>
</div>
<div id="performance-assessment" class="section level3">
<h3>Performance Assessment</h3>
<p>Participants completed a simulated 30-km time trial 180 min following
ingestion of the test meal. With their personal bicycle mounted to the
CompuTrainer® and tire pressures standardized, participants performed a
10-minute warm up followed by calibration of the press-on force of the
load generator per manufacturer’s guidelines. Participants then
completed the 30-km time trial on a virtual course in the RacerMate One™
software (RacerMate Inc., Seattle, WA). A copy of the course file can be
found at <a href="https://osf.io/ujx6e/"
class="uri">https://osf.io/ujx6e/</a>. Participants were instructed to
complete the time trial as quickly as possible and were verbally
encouraged throughout the trial. Participants’ heart rate was monitored
continuously using a Polar H7 heart rate sensor and chest strap (Polar
Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland). Respiratory gas measurements and ratings
of perceived exertion (RPE) on a 6-20 Borg Scale were collected at 3 km
and every 6 km thereafter.</p>

<div id="respiratory-gas-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Respiratory Gas Analysis</h3>
<p>Respiratory gas measurements were collected using an open circuit
automated gas analysis system (TrueOne2400, Parvo Medics, Sandy, UT).
Participants breathed through a two-way valve (Hans Rudolph, Shawnee,
KS) attached to a 7450 Series Silicone V2TM Oro-Nasal Mask (Hans
Rudolph) for three min at each collection time point. Substrate
oxidation was calculated using the following equations <span

<h3>Muscle Ultrasound</h3>
<p>Session fuel percentile was determined using ultrasonic assessment of
the right and left rectus femoris. Session fuel percentile provides an
estimate of the muscle content of glycogen and other constituents based
on the mean pixel intensity of an ultrasound image. Ultrasonic imaging
was performed with a diagnostic high-resolution GE LOGIQ-e (GE
Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) using a 9L transducer at 8 Hz. Images from
both rectus femoris muscles were taken in triplicate. Ultrasound images
were uploaded via DICOM to a secure cloud-based web application
(MuscleSound Inc, Denver, CO), which analyzes the echogenicity of the
ultrasound image as an estimate of the content of muscle glycogen and
other constituents. This method has been shown to correlate highly with
glycogen content measured by muscle biopsy <span class="citation">(<a

personal communications with the company, we used the session fuel
percentile score, which was implemented after publication of the
MuscleSound® position stand on the application of the system <span

<h3>Time to Completion and Average Power Output</h3>
<p>As described above, the study was powered based on a time to
completion analysis of finishing times at the Texas State Time Trial
Championships. Thus, we deemed time to completion for the present time
trial our primary outcome measure. However, following the completion of
three participants, we identified an error in our protocol that caused
assigned rider weights in the RacerMate One™ software to be incorrect
for some participants/conditions. The software calculates the speed the
avatar achieves on the virtual course using rider weight, bike weight,
road gradient, and measured power output. Thus, several finishing times
were incorrect. Therefore, we present the average power outputs during
the time trial as our measure of endurance performance below. Further,
we discuss considerations regarding the calculations that produce speed
output from power input in the RacerMate One™ software in the Discussion
section. As detailed above, since we did not achieve the desired
statistical power, we only present means and standard deviations for
these outcome measures; inferential statistics are not presented.</p>

<div id="statistical-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Statistical Analysis</h3>
<p>All analyses were performed in the R statistical environment <span

<h3>Exploratory Analyses</h3>
<p>Missing data for exploratory analyses (e.g., session fuel percentile)
were imputed using the MICE package in R <span class="citation">(<a

using the PAN method created by <span class="citation">Schafer &amp;
Yucel (<a href="#ref-49" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>.
Exploratory variables were analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model
with a Holm-Bonferroni post hoc test using the lme4 and emmeans packages
in R <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-50"
role="doc-biblioref">Bates et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-51"
role="doc-biblioref">Lenth et al., 2019</a>)</span>. Fixed effects for
these models include diet (habitual, ketogenic, high carbohydrate) and
time trial time points (3km, 9km, 15km, 21km, 27km). Participant
intercept was treated as a random effect. While prior research would
have allowed the generation of directional hypotheses regarding
respiratory exchange ratio, substrate oxidation, and RPE, we treated
these variables as exploratory, since we did not power the study to
these variables. Alpha level was set at 0.05 for all exploratory
analyses.</p>

<h3>Control Variables</h3>
<p>Dietary intake, body mass, physical activity, environmental
conditions during the time trial, and capillary beta-hydroxy-butyrate
were treated as control variables. Potential mean differences in body
mass by diet condition, dietary intake, and capillary
beta-hydroxybutyrate were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models as
explained above. Differences in environmental conditions (humidity and
fluid intake), were analyzed using standard linear models. We did not
perform statistical analysis of lab temperature, since the temperature
was 22.0 degrees during all but four trials, where the temperature was
21.0 degrees. Potential mean differences in physical activity (total
distance and sRPE) between diet conditions were assessed using paired

<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>Our results suggest that recreational endurance athletes’ power
output during a cycling time trial is potentially reduced following 14
days of a ketogenic diet when compared with 14-days of a high
carbohydrate diet. This reduction suggests that the observed increase in
fat oxidation during the time trial did not translate to a performance
improvement or maintenance. This could be in part due to reduced muscle
glycogen availability prior to the time trial following the ketogenic
diet, which we observed in the form of decreased session fuel percentile
measured using skeletal muscle ultrasound.</p>
<p>Our findings are in accordance with Burke et al. <span
class="citation">(<a href="#ref-19" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>, <a
href="#ref-20" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>, who demonstrated
endurance performance decrements following a ketogenic diet despite
increased fat oxidation, which they attributed to reduced exercise
economy. While we were unable to directly assess cycling efficiency due
to our protocol, this could be a potential mechanism explaining the
decreased power output during the ketogenic diet condition in the
present study. Studies investigating longer and lower-intensity exercise
tasks have demonstrated potential benefits of the ketogenic diet on
endurance performance <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-7"
role="doc-biblioref">Lambert et al., 1994</a>; <a href="#ref-22"
role="doc-biblioref">McSwiney et al., 2018</a>)</span>. While lower than
originally expected, participants in the present study worked at higher
relative intensities for shorter durations compared with those
investigations. Thus, it appears that endurance athletes might benefit
or experience no performance decrements following a ketogenic diet when
competing in longer, lower-intensity events, while adverse effects might
arise during shorter, higher-intensity tasks. A recent review by <span
class="citation">McSwiney et al. (<a href="#ref-52"
role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> details the effect of KD on a
variety of exercise tasks across different populations.</p>
<p>The increase in fat oxidation rates exhibited by participants in the
present study was lower than what has been reported by other
investigators <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-6"
role="doc-biblioref">Carey et al., 1985</a>)</span>, while overall
substrate oxidation patterns were similar to the existing literature
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-18" role="doc-biblioref">Burke et
al., 1985</a>, <a href="#ref-19" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>, <a

href="#ref-17" role="doc-biblioref">Volek et al., 2016</a>)</span>.
However, it is important to note that we measured substrate oxidation
during a self-paced time trial, rather than during a constant-load
exercise task.</p>
<p>While some studies have questioned the validity and utility of using
skeletal muscle ultrasound to estimate muscle glycogen content <span
class="citation">(<a href="#ref-45" role="doc-biblioref">Bone et al.,
2021</a>; <a href="#ref-46" role="doc-biblioref">Routledge et al.,
2019</a>)</span>, we successfully detected expected decreases in muscle
“fuel” using the MuscleSound® session fuel percentile score. Although
our analyses did not achieve statistical significance, we observed
strong directional results suggesting reduced muscle fuel following the
ketogenic diet as well as following the time trial across all
conditions. While we did not measure muscle glycogen content directly,
and thus cannot speak to the relationship between session fuel
percentile and muscle glycogen directly, we believe that SFP is a
measure that is sensitive enough to detect changes induced by exercise
and diet. Due to its non-invasive nature and ease of application, this
ultrasonic technique appears to be a valuable tool that allows athletes
and practitioners to estimate muscle “fuel” changes in response to
dietary and exercise interventions.</p>
<div id="methodological-insights-and-considerations"
class="section level2">
<h2>Methodological Insights and Considerations</h2>
<div id="cycle-ergometer" class="section level3">
<h3>Cycle Ergometer</h3>
<p>Based on participant feedback during previous studies and pilot work
as well as to minimize learning effects, we chose to use the
CompuTrainer® cycle ergometer as our testing device. This allowed
participants to mount their own bicycle to the ergometer maximizing
familiarity with the equipment. In prior work in our laboratory, some
participants had voiced concerns that bicycle fit was suboptimal with
other ergometers, such as the Velotron Pro (RacerMate Inc., Seattle, WA)
and Monark Ergomedic 894e (Monark, Sweden). In a meta-analysis by <span
class="citation">Hopkins et al. (<a href="#ref-53"
role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span>, cycle ergometers that allowed
participants to use their own bicycles produced some of the smallest
coefficients of variation in the study. Participants in the present
study expressed that they favored using their own equipment over using
other ergometers, validating our choice of equipment.</p>
<p>However, certain challenges can come with the use of ergometers that
allow participants to use their own bicycles. First, tire inflation
pressure, and press-on force between the tire and the friction roller of
the load generator must be standardized for each condition between
conditions. The manufacturer’s manual for the CompuTrainer® suggests
inflating tires to the maximum rated tire pressure and provides a guide
for setting the POF based on maximal road gradients or maximal expected
power output during the exercise bout. We decided to standardize tire
pressure at 100 psi unless the tires were rated for lower pressure.
However, unbeknownst to the investigators present at the trial, one of
our participants used an inner tube in a tubeless tire during one time
trial, causing over inflation and tire failure. This illuminates another
challenge in allowing participants to use their own bicycles: the need
to ensure that participants don’t make changes to their equipment
between trials. One of our participants changed tires between
conditions; the new tires were rated at a lower pressure than the ones
he used in the initial trial. However, the participant had discarded the
old tires, thus making it impossible to keep tire pressure constant
across trials. Data for this participant are not included in this
manuscript, since we had to terminate the study prior to his final
experimental trial due to COVID-19 regulations.</p>
</div>
<div id="performance-measure" class="section level3">
<h3>Performance Measure</h3>
<p>To maximize external validity, we decided to use a time trial that
was similar in length (time) to what our participants typically
experience in competition. To align our statistical inference with this
strategy, we powered our study to be able to detect a practical
meaningful difference of 90 seconds between the high carbohydrate and
ketogenic conditions, which, on average, reflected an improvement of one
position in the final standings of the Texas State Time Trial
Championships across the past four years. Thus, we selected time to
completion as our primary outcome measure. While we have used time to
completion successfully in previous work using the Velotron and Monark
894e, the use of this measure with the CompuTrainer® created additional
challenges. As described above, an error in our protocol caused
inconsistencies in the rider weight used during CompuTrainer® setup.
While the RacerMate One™ software manual provides load curves for the
ergometer, we were unable to determine the exact formula to translate
power output (W) to speed (km/h); one factor influencing this is the
built-in Drag FactorTM function, which allows users to set a percentage
based “drag factor” equivalent to an estimated coefficient of
aerodynamic drag multiplied by the frontal area of the rider. The
default value for this and rolling resistance are unknown to the
authors. Our initial strategy was to recalculate finishing times for
each participant by using the speed achieved per watt measured during
the initial time trial (following their habitual diet). We applied this
speed-per-watt factor to the measured power outputs for all other trials
to recalculate finishing times (Table 3). Calculation scripts and
speed-per-watt data for each rider by road gradient can be found at <a
href="https://osf.io/ujx6e/" class="uri">https://osf.io/ujx6e/</a>.</p>
<p>Using the crude estimation of speed-per-watt employed for our
recalculation of time to completion, it appears that even when setting
the rider weight and press-on-force to nearly identical values a
meaningful difference in speed and finishing time arises. Participant 17
completed the time trial in the ketogenic condition (rider weight: 68.0
kg; bike weight: 10 kg; POF: 3.06 lbs.; drag factor: 100%) and high
carbohydrate condition (rider weight: 68.0 kg; bike weight: 10 kg;
press-on-force: 3.07; drag factor: 100%) with nearly identical settings
but received meaningfully different speed-per-watt values. This is in
part due to the increase in coefficient of aerodynamic drag with
increasing speed, as the wind resistance experienced by a rider becomes
greater at higher speed. With the participant riding slower during the
time trial in the ketogenic condition, the software correctly generated
greater speed-per-watt in this condition compared with the high
carbohydrate condition. To control this factor and to further
investigate the speed achieved for the power applied, we analyzed
speed-per-watt at different power outputs across the two trials.
Further, we compared these numbers to a model of overground road cycling
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-54" role="doc-biblioref">Gribble,
2021</a>)</span>, which allows manual entry of all parameters associated
to cycling (Figure 8).</p>
<p>We limited the analysis to flat stretches of the TT to eliminate the
effect of road gradient and only included power outputs between 100 W
and 200 W. It was apparent, that speed-per-watt values fluctuated
greatly immediately following return from a descent to a flat stretch on
the course After removing the 20 seconds following each descent and
large outliers based on visual inspection of the graph, we fit a power
function for all three analyses.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/figure8.png" alt="Figure 8: Speed-per-Watt at Different Power Outputs." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 8: Speed-per-Watt at Different Power Outputs.
</p>
</div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>As Table 4 shows, even small differences in the speed-per-watts
conversion can have meaningful effects on finishing time during a
simulated time trial (see Supplemental Table S2) At a fictitious power
output of 150 in a flat time trial, the conversion alone would lead to a
difference of 44.4 seconds in time to completion. These conversion
calculations were highly sensitive to the inclusion/exclusion of
individual datapoints as the same power input can result in different
instantaneous speed output. Actual differences might not be as large, as
individual datapoints account for only one second of the speed achieved.
However, in the high carbohydrate trial shown above, power output was
measured at 150W on flat road sections 41 times, with speed-per-watt
ranging from 0.179 km/h/W (26.8 km/h) to 0.202 km/h/W (30.3 km/h). It is
important to note, that despite these challenges, the CompuTrainer® very
closely mirrors the time achieved in an overground road cycling time
trial.</p>
<p>Despite some limitations regarding the conversion of power output to
speed and the challenges of standardizing between conditions, we believe
the CompuTrainer® is an effective tool for performance analysis. The
familiarity of participants with their own equipment and the positive
feedback regarding bicycle fit and feel may outweigh any challenges
faced with implementing this performance assessment. Based on our
experience in this project, we recommend using mean power output during
a time trial as the performance outcome variable rather than time to
completion. We also suggest extensive piloting of the time trial course
and protocols to ensure all important factors are kept constant between
conditions. Further, we recommend giving participants written
instructions to avoid any changes to their equipment and checking all
aspects of the bicycle setup (including tires) on the day of the
trial.</p>
<p>Additionally, we would recommend researchers employing a repeated
measures design use participant’s actual body mass on the day of each
trial as rider weight. Since the RacerMate One™ software accurately
models differences in rider weight, potential benefits from decreased
body mass on cycling speed, especially during uphill sections of a
course, should be captured by the performance assessment.</p>

present study requires considerable labor and time from the
investigators as well as personal investment from participants. The
following section discusses insights and considerations regarding the
nutritional intervention.</p>
<div id="diet-tracking-and-meal-planning." class="section level3">
<h3>Diet Tracking and Meal Planning.</h3>
<p>Following dietary interventions like the ones employed in the present
study requires careful tracking of nutrition intake and exercise energy
expenditure. The participants in our study provided verbal feedback that
tracking their dietary intake and finding foods to match the
macronutrient requirements for each diet added a sizeable burden to
their daily routines. With this in mind, it is unsurprising that less
than 20% of recreational cyclists regularly track their nutritional
intake (unpublished data from a survey study conducted in our
laboratory). In fact, in our pre-study screening questionnaire, none of
the participants in the present study reported tracking total energy
intake or macronutrients nor following a specific diet. It stands to
reason that keeping a record of dietary intake and planning meals to
achieve certain nutritional goals might create a steep barrier for
recreational athletes trying to follow high carbohydrate or ketogenic
diets.</p>
<p>Similarly, participants reported struggling to consume the high
percentage of carbohydrate to fulfill the requirements of the high
carbohydrate diet without resorting to sugary drinks and foods. This
could be one reason why our own findings and those of other researchers
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-58" role="doc-biblioref">Worme et
al., 1990</a>)</span> suggest, that free-living recreational endurance
athletes consume less carbohydrate than what is recommended for
optimizing performance <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-1"
role="doc-biblioref">Thomas et al., 2016</a>)</span>. The strongest
experimental design regarding diet adherence would include supplying
food for participants throughout the study. This would take the burden
of diet tracking and meal planning off the participants. However, this
is difficult and costly with a free-living cohort such as ours.</p>
</div>
<div id="diet-adherence." class="section level3">
<h3>Diet Adherence.</h3>
<p>Our three-day dietary records indicated that participants followed
the intervention diets as prescribed, with the exception of
higher-than-desired protein intake during the ketogenic diet
(Supplemental Table S1). Yet, based on levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate in
urine and blood during the ketogenic diet, participants met our
requirement of being in a ketogenic state. Based on verbal and written
feedback from our participants, even with the daily feedback they
received from the registered dietitian, participants struggled to find
high-fat foods that limited their intake of protein. However, it appears
that the protein intake in our ketogenic diet condition (26.0 ± 2.9% of
total energy intake) was similar to what other studies have reported
when participants were allowed to consume protein ad libitum <span
class="citation">(<a href="#ref-55" role="doc-biblioref">Brehm et al.,
2003</a>, <a href="#ref-56" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>; <a
href="#ref-57" role="doc-biblioref">Yancy et al., 2004</a>)</span>.
Thus, allowing ad libitum intake of protein during the ketogenic diet
condition appears to be a practical way to reduce the burden on
participants to find low-protein high-fat foods. To control for the
effect of changes in fat-free body mass, which could have an impact on
exercise performance, we suggest measuring body composition following
each diet, if resources allow it. In the present study, equipment
availability prohibited us from performing these measurements.</p>
</div>
<div id="blinding" class="section level3">
<h3>Blinding</h3>
<p>Blinding of participants to the study condition is impossible in a
study design like the present. Participants’ effort during training and
performance assessment could be influenced by preconceived opinions
about the interventions employed. Recent research has shown that
recreational endurance athletes are more aware of the effects of
carbohydrate intake before, during, and after events than the general
public <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-59"
role="doc-biblioref">Sampson et al., 2021</a>)</span>. Thus,
participants might have expected to perform worse during the ketogenic
diet condition. This became apparent in the present study from verbal
comments by the participants, who mentioned not looking forward to
completing the ketogenic diet condition. Additionally, during the
ketogenic diet, they reported feeling like they could not produce the
same amount of power and fatiguing more quickly during training rides.
One participant completed the time trial approximately 13 min slower
during the ketogenic condition than during the habitual and high
carbohydrate conditions. This participant specifically expressed feeling
fatigued during the ketogenic diet. It is unclear whether a preconceived
notion of the ketogenic diet on endurance performance might have
impacted the participant’s effort during the time trial or whether the
participant truly experienced such strong effects of the diet.</p>

<div id="statistical-analysis-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Statistical Analysis</h2>
</div>
<div id="sample-heterogeneity-and-statistical-power"
class="section level2">
<h2>Sample Heterogeneity and Statistical Power</h2>
<p>Our goal for the present study was to collect data from men and women
across a wider age-range than previously reported in the literature.
However, this has important implications on statistical power. Based on
our analysis of the Texas State Time Trial Championships, finishing
times and standard deviations of the top 10 athletes in male and female
age groups up to 55+ years old (61 ± 6 min) was similar to pilot work on
the CompuTrainer® course in our own lab (60 ± 6). However, our final
sample comprised athletes with much greater heterogeneity in the main
performance outcome. This sample heterogeneity has a drastic impact on
statistical power in a frequentist framework [<span
class="citation">Heidel (<a href="#ref-60"
role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>;61].</p>
<p>We attempted to limit sample heterogeneity by requiring minimum
training experience and distance along with a VO<sub>2</sub>max
criterion for enrollment in the study. Average time to completion of the
time trial was similar to what we expected, but standard deviations in
our sample ranged from 8.0 min (habitual condition) to 13.2 min
(ketogenic condition). Simply raising the standard deviation in our
power analysis from 6.0 to 10.2 (average of our observed standard
deviations), while leaving all other parameters the same would decrease
statistical power for the omnibus test with 30 participants from 90% to
45%. One avenue to further limit this heterogeneity and increase
statistical power, would be employing a time trial as part of the
screening process to ensure participants can complete the course in a
predetermined maximal time or at a predetermined minimal average power
output. This trial could also serve as a familiarization trial for
participants to become accustomed to the laboratory and the bike
setup.</p>
<div id="analysis-options." class="section level3">
<h3>Analysis Options.</h3>
<p>A common strategy to analyze data like the present is to employ
repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA). However, other fields
including psychology, biology, and medicine, have transitioned to using
linear mixed-effects models for designs similar to ours <span
class="citation">(<a href="#ref-62" role="doc-biblioref">Boisgontier
&amp; Cheval, 2016</a>)</span>. In the following section we present
different analysis options for our primary outcome (time to completion)
and for one example of a secondary outcomes (carbohydrate oxidation). To
avoid reporting inferential statistics based on observed data of our
primary outcome, we used simulated data to show the different analysis
options. All simulations and analysis scripts can be found here: <a
href="https://osf.io/ujx6e/" class="uri">https://osf.io/ujx6e/</a></p>
<p>We investigated the outcome of three statistical methods to analyze
our primary outcome (TTC) with simulated data based on the following
parameters using the faux package in R <span class="citation">(<a
href="#ref-63" role="doc-biblioref">DeBruine et al.,
2021</a>)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>n = 18 Habitual condition: µ = 61.0 min; σ = 8.0 min High
carbohydrate condition: µ = 60.0 min; σ = 9.0 min Ketogenic condition: µ
= 62.5 min; σ = 10.5 min</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These parameters are loosely based on our actual data in combination
with the practically meaningful effect size of 90 seconds discussed
above. The three methods investigated were: 1) linear mixed-effects
models using the lme4 package, 2) standard RM-ANOVA using the afex
package, and 3) analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), as recommended by <span
class="citation">Senn (<a href="#ref-64"
role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span> using the rstatix package <span
class="citation">(<a href="#ref-65" role="doc-biblioref">rstatix,
2021</a>)</span>. As an example of the secondary outcome analysis, we
chose observed data for carbohydrate oxidation and analyzed them using
1) linear mixed-effects models and 2) condition x time RM-ANOVA.
Inferential statistics for all analyses are shown in Supplemental Table
S3.</p>
<p>To further analyze statistical outcomes of these strategies, we
investigated pairwise comparisons of the estimated marginal mean
differences using the emmeans and statix packages. Results for time to
completion are shown in Supplemental Table S4. We used a Holm correction
for multiple comparisons and a Bonferroni correction for the 95%
confidence intervals reported.</p>
<p>All three strategies result in similar omnibus test for time to
completion leading to the same inferential interpretation. As expected,
the results for time to completion were nearly identical between models.
Interestingly, there were important differences in the comparisons for
estimated marginal mean differences. While the point estimates for mean
differences between conditions were exactly the same for linear
mixed-effects models and RM-ANOVA, the 95% CI differed considerably,
leading to a different inferential interpretation (see Supplemental
Table S4) The RM-ANOVA yielded a statistically significant difference
between habitual and high carbohydrate conditions, whereas the linear
mixed-effects model did not. Confidence intervals were wider in the
linear mixed-effects model for the habitual vs. high carbohydrate
comparison only, but narrower for the other comparisons. One downside to
the ANCOVA approach is that it only allowed for pairwise comparison
between high carbohydrate and ketogenic conditions, since time to
completion from the time trial in the habitual condition was used as a
covariate.</p>
<p>When analyzing carbohydrate oxidation, the omnibus tests for both
models indicated main effects for condition and time without an
interaction. However, only the linear mixed-effects model showed
significant differences in the follow-up pairwise comparisons. The
results for post hoc comparison of estimated marginal means in the
linear mixed-effects model indicated significant difference when
comparing carbohydrate oxidation at the 3km mark in the time trial
compared with all other time points. Interestingly, while the omnibus
test for the RM-ANOVA did indicate a main effect for time, none of the
follow-up pairwise comparisons were statistically significant.</p>
<p>Based on this analysis, we suggest researchers explore the option of
using a linear mixed-effects model in similar designs. The linear
mixed-effects model as applied here allows for a random intercept for
each participant; further benefits of linear mixed-effects model allow
the specification of additional random effects (e.g., participant-level
slopes) and using multiple imputation to handle missing data <span
class="citation">(<a href="#ref-66" role="doc-biblioref">Harrison et
al., 2018</a>)</span> as employed in our analysis of the muscle
ultrasound data. When deciding between an RM-ANOVA and an ANCOVA,
researchers should consider the study design and research questions. In
the present study, we chose the linear mixed-effects model over ANCOVA
to allow for the pairwise comparison of all three conditions. It could
be argued, that an ANCOVA approach would have been prudent, since we did
not control diet in the habitual condition; thus, the habitual condition
would have lent itself as a true baseline test used as a covariate in
the comparison of high carbohydrate and ketogenic conditions. However,
we believe that this also allowed a true comparison of a truly habitual
condition compared to two controlled conditions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="conclusions" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>We found that participants completed a simulated 30-km time trial at
the lowest mean power output following two weeks of the ketogenic diet.
We also showed that fat oxidation was greatest during the time trial
following the ketogenic diet and lowest following the high carbohydrate
diet. Further, MuscleSound® session fuel percentile, an estimate of
muscle “fuel” was lower following the ketogenic diet compared to the
habitual diet; additionally, session fuel percentile was lower following
the time trial compared to fasted baseline measures and 3-hour post-meal
measures. In summary, while this study did not achieve the desired
sample size to make inferential claims about the effects of the
ketogenic and high carbohydrate diets on endurance exercise performance,
we believe that the insights gained from our work could be valuable to
other researchers, athletes, and practitioners. We argue that allowing
participants to use their own bicycles for studies like this on a cycle
ergometer such as the CompuTrainer® reduces learning effects and
minimizes the need for familiarization; further, it provides a valid
measurement of endurance exercise performance, as long as
standardization protocols are followed and appropriate outcome measures
(e.g., mean power output during a time trial) are selected. Further, we
contend that employing linear mixed-effects models should be the
preferred analysis technique for repeated measures design in a
frequentist framework. Linear mixed-effects models offer the option to
include random intercepts at the participant level, which allows
modeling of inter-individual response differences better than using a
fixed intercept. Further, linear mixed-effects models allow multiple
imputation of missing data, providing a route for researchers to use
partial data for participants rather than being forced to delete data
listwise, as is typically done using RM-ANOVA. Depending on the study
design and research question, ANCOVA with baseline performance as the
covariate also offers a valid analysis strategy. In light of the
findings by Burke et al. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-19"
role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>, <a href="#ref-20"
role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> that exercise economy might be
reduced following a ketogenic diet, we suggest that future studies
should include steady-state exercise that allows the measurement of
mechanical efficiency or exercise economy. Finally, we believe that
using muscle ultrasound for a determination of muscle “fuel” using the
MuscleSound® session fuel percentile offers a valuable and easy-to-use
tool for practitioners and athletes.</p>

<div id="practical-applications" class="section level2">
<h2>Practical Applications</h2>
<p>From a practical perspective, following strict diets in the long-term
adds considerable burdens to recreational athletes’ lives. Thus, a more
reasonable approach might be to “fuel for the work required”, as
proposed by <span class="citation">Impey et al. (<a href="#ref-67"
role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. In this paradigm, athletes base
their carbohydrate requirements on the work anticipated and/or performed
on a given day. Often, recreational cyclists will complete longer
training sessions (five to six hours) on weekends and more intense
sessions on one or two days during the week. To minimize the added labor
and stress of daily macronutrient and energy tracking, athletes could
increase carbohydrate intake on the day prior to and during longer
and/or more intense training sessions, while eating entirely ad libitum
on days with easier rides. Recreational athletes using power meters,
could calculate energy expenditure based on the average power produced
during a ride. In fact, most exercise tracking applications, which are
popular among this population, already provide energy expenditure
measures based on actual work performed when power meter data are
included. Those who do not use power meters, could use heart rate and/or
the talk test to estimate energy expenditure and exercise intensity
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-68"
role="doc-biblioref">Hiilloskorpi et al., 2003</a>; <a href="#ref-69"
role="doc-biblioref">Quinn &amp; Coons, 2011</a>)</span>. These
calculations would allow recreational athletes to fuel longer and harder
sessions adequately, while not needing to invest the time and energy to
plan and track dietary intake on shorter and easier days.</p>
<p>Single-session carbohydrate restriction for certain low to moderate
intensity workouts, i.e., “training low”, has been shown to be effective
in augmenting gene expression, cell signaling, and oxidative enzyme
activity related with improved endurance performance (67, 70) <span
class="citation">(<a href="#ref-70" role="doc-biblioref">Impey et al.,
2016</a>, <a href="#ref-67" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. These
strategies might be more feasible and sensible for elite athletes, who
typically work with nutrition professionals and often have already
optimized all other aspects of their training and racing. However,
recreational cyclists looking to use this strategy could implement a
higher intensity training session in the morning followed by
carbohydrate restriction and a lower intensity training session in the
evening <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-70"
role="doc-biblioref">Impey et al., 2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In summary, recreational athletes looking to improve their cycling
performance using nutrition interventions might be better served by
focusing on “fueling for the work required” <span class="citation">(<a
href="#ref-67" role="doc-biblioref">Impey et al., 2018</a>)</span> and
interspersing occasional training session with low carbohydrate
availability than by trying to implement a daily diet designed to
restrict or enhance the intake of carbohydrate.</p>
